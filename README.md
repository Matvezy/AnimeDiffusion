# AnimeDiffusion
Training a diffusion model to generate anime/cartoon images.
This project was inspired by the fact that current image text-to-image models like Dalle-2 or Imagen don't produce the highest quality anime images. So I decided to train a diffusion model (without CLIP and text part) to generate anime/cartoon images. 

This project utilizes the Tagged Anime Illustrations dataset from Kaggle, which is not included in the repository and can be found here:

This project is for my learning purposes, and it is currently in the development stage. I will post updates and results here.
